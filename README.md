Clipper
=====
Clipper is a known / popular third-party tool for the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XI.

Features
=====
Clipper always players to adjust certain aspects of the game including:
  * Player Status (Always on chocobo, maintenance mode (clipping)).
  * GM Flag (Allows removal of collision detection.)
  * JAWait0 (Removes model locking when performing actions.)
  * Speed Hacking (Allows advanced movement beyond normal means.)
  * Position Adjustments (Forces players to move a direction regardless of terrain.)
  * Locking Z Coord (Allows players to walk in air, "floating".)
  * Auto-disabling features to help prevent being detected/caught using all the tools.

History
=====
Maintenance mode (aka originally known as Clipper) was found and released in 2004/2005 by Wiccaan. After several updates the original Clipper tool broke and was revived by other players. Recently, Clipper has turned into another popular tool called 'Cupper'. 

Since then Wiccaan has revived the original Clipper project to create a more self-sufficient tool to remove the need for recompiling the base project. Instead, this new Clipper is based entirely on using a configuration file to remove the need to edit the source when updates to the game happen. _(However, some changes may be required depending on the amount of changes made to the game.)_
